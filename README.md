# Beer-Analysis
An in depth look at craft beers and brewery analysis

For our last project, we will be tackling data on beer and breweries (And possibly the reviews on each beer???). The data we will be using are listed here:
https://data.world/mathiasburton/beer-curious/workspace/file?filename=styles.csv
https://data.world/socialmediadata/beeradvocate/workspace/file?filename=beer_reviews.csv
https://www.kaggle.com/nickhould/craft-cans
The data houses information about all sorts of beers from your good ole Bud light to something like a crafted beer called Citra *** Down. We will be diving into the columns called ABV and IBU which are abbreviation that looks at the beer alcoholic content and how bitter the drink is respectively. 
For machine learning, we will be looking to use linear regression to describe the relationship between ABV and IBU and be able to predict the IBU/ABV when given a value for either ABV, IBU or even name of a beer. We will also be using another machine learning library which utilizes a library called recsys for python that can create a recommender system. Through this system, we hope to be able to build a system that can recommend beers to a user when they pick either one beer or a list of them. We will be looking to use Python Pandas to do our machine learning and data mangling. Then, we will be using Tableau to perform our visualizations to present our findings/interesting information found in the data. The interesting information that we may present about are as follow but are not limited to:
Which breweries has the most unique beer?
Most common style of beer? (i.e. Fruit Beer, Scotch Ale)
Mean ABV?
Using machine learning to Predict style based on name or type of beer.
Top Cities/States with Breweries
Number of breweries in each state
Cities with the most breweries per person
